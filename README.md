# PyMath Initiative Project - Algorithms & Mathematics

## 📘 About the Project

This repository contains the official training materials, presentations, and assignments for **Work Package 2 (WP2): Algorithms and Mathematics** of the **PyMath Initiative Project**.

**PyMath** is an Erasmus+ KA220-SCH (Cooperation partnerships in school education) project aimed at increasing high school students' interest in mathematics through coding and algorithmic thinking. The project integrates abstract mathematical concepts with concrete programming applications, fostering interdisciplinary skills in STEM.

### 🎓 Prepared By

## 🎯 Objectives of Work Package 2

This module focuses on the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking. Before diving into complex syntax, students learn to visualize problems, create logical flows, and solve mathematical equations using Flowcharts and basic Python concepts.

**Key Learning Outcomes:**

  * Understanding the logic of **Algorithms** and **Pseudocode**.
  * Mastering **Flowcharts** using Flowgorithm.
  * Learning **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**.
  * Implementing **Loops (For, While)** and **Conditional Statements**.
  * Using **Functions** and **Arrays** for mathematical problem solving.
  * Introduction to **Turtle Graphics** for visual mathematics.
